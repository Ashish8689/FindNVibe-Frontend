              This website is created several months in advance and FIND N VIBE

              tour. In case the alternative arrangement or services made are
              materially superior as compared to the one described; we may
              charge extra for the same.
            </li>
            <li>
              We at FIND N VIBE are committed to delivering whatever is promised
              to you, but due to the circumstances beyond our control like heavy
              traffic, delayed flights, flight cancellations, missed
              connections, long lines, less daylight, bad weather conditions,
              border or police checks, coach break down, accidents, VIP
              movement, riots, strikes, extremist attacks, festivals,
              earthquake, fire, war, volcanic ash, religious rituals, heavy
              snowfall, airport closure or any other reason whatsoever, if you
              miss any sightseeing or if you get less time to cover any museum
              or any sightseeing then FIND N VIBE is not responsible or liable
              for the same.
            </li>
            <li>
              FIND N VIBE recommends that not more than three persons share a
              room. A triple room is normally of the same size as a double room.
              In the case of a triple room, the third bed is usually a roll-away
              bed or folding cot.
            </li>
            <li>
              As the client would be out sightseeing most of the time and retire
              to the room only for the night, FIND N VIBE selects hotels at
              locations, which give comfort and value for money. Hence depending
              on the day-to-day itinerary, the hotel may be confirmed either in
              the city or away from the city centre. Some hotels do not have air
              conditioners, room heaters, or fans. Double rooms in Europe are
              comparatively small and single rooms are even smaller. A double
              room has either a single queen-size bed or two separate beds. If
              the client requests for a room with a queen-size bed, the same
              would be provided subject to availability as the majority of the
              hotels in Europe have twin bedded rooms. In case of
              non-availability of a room with queen-size bed, a twin bedded-room
              would be given.
            </li>
            <li>
              A child for whom “without bed” charge has been paid would not be
              entitled to a separate bed in the hotel. In case the “with a bed”
              charge has been paid for the child and the client decides not to
              avail of such facility whilst on the tour, he would not be
              entitled to any refund. In case the client decides to seek an
              extra bed on tour for the child booked on a “without bed basis”
              then subject to availability, he shall be bound to pay an
              additional amount charged to the concerned Hotel directly. In case
              of a request at the time of booking by the client for preference
              of nearby or interconnecting or adjoining rooms, FIND N VIBE would
              take every effort for the same, however as the Hotel management
              does rooms allocations, hence there is no assurance in this
              regard.
            </li>
            <li>
              The clients/customers will have to abide by the check-in and
              check-out times of the Hotels. The guest should themselves manage
              early arrivals and late departures. (In case of individual travels
              or case of direct joining or direct leaving passengers.) The
              average traveling time by coach can be approximately 8 hours a day
              under normal road conditions. Comfort stops are provided after
              appropriate intervals having regard to the daily double room. In
              the case of a triple room, the third bed is usually a roll-away
              bed or folding cot.

              preference of nearby or interconnecting or adjoining rooms, FIND N
              VIBE would take every effort for the same, however as the Hotel
              management does rooms allocations, hence there is no assurance in

              The clients/customers will have to abide by the check-in and

            <li>
              The average traveling time by coach can be approximately 8 hours a
              day under normal road conditions. Comfort stops are provided after
              appropriate intervals having regard to the daily itinerary and
              therefore, though some of the coaches are equipped with emergency
              washrooms, such facilities can be used only in case of an
              emergency.
            </li>
            <li>
              Smoking, consumption of alcoholic beverages, ice creams, chewing
              gum, and snacks is strictly prohibited on coaches.
            </li>
            <li>
              The clients should not leave behind any personal item/property in
              the coach/car while disembarking the coach. FIND N VIBE will not
              be responsible or liable in case of loss of any personal item or
              any such property either in the coach, car, hotel, any sightseeing
              place, flight, taxi, cable car, cruise, ferry, train, tram, or
              restaurants under any circumstances.
            </li>
            <li>
              No seats are reserved except the first two seats for the tour
              manager. We find it fair to enforce daily seat rotation. Please
              adhere to the instructions given by the tour manager in this
              regard.
            </li>
            <li>
              As per the law in many countries, it is mandatory to wear a seat
              belt in the coach. If the client is not wearing the same, he/she
              may have to pay a fine to the police / local authorities. Any
              damage or loss done to you during the travel by the coach because
              you were not wearing a seatbelt is not covered by your travel
              insurance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any damage caused by you to the coach, car, taxi, hotel, cruise,
              ferries, trains, restaurants for any reason whatsoever, will be
              paid for by you to the respective service provider. FIND N VIBE
              will not be liable for the same.
            </li>
            <li>
              Meals provided by Restaurants / Hotels are as per menu. Planet In
              Holidays, however, reserves the right to change the meal
              arrangement, if circumstances make it necessary to do so.
            </li>
            <li>
              FIND N VIBE cannot assure special meal or diet for the
              Client/Customer. If the Client misses or refrains from availing
              any meal arranged by FIND N VIBE due to any reasons whatsoever,
              there would be no refund, for the same.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Client/Customer traveling by Air would be subject to the
              Airline restrictions or limitations on baggage weight/size/number.
              As porterage is not included in the tour price and due to limited
              space for luggage in the coach, it is recommended that the Client
              should carry one single suitcase per person, preferably with
              wheels for sake of convenience. The airline may charge extra for
              bags more than a specific weight. Such additional charges will be
              borne directly by the client/customer.
            </li>
            <li>
              All baggage and personal effects are at all times and in all
              circumstances the responsibility of the Client/Customer. FIND N
              VIBE shall not be liable for the loss or the delay or theft or
              damage of baggage by Trains / Airline / Hotel/ Cruise/ Coach/
              Coach driver/ Porters or any other carrier or service provider.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is strongly advised to Clients / Customers not to carry any
              valuables on tour. However, if the Client carries any valuables,
              the same should be in his / her custody all the time or maybe kept
              in the safe deposit lockers, that are commonly made available in
              most of the Hotels. However, FIND N VIBE will not be responsible
              for the loss of valuables or for making good any such loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tipping is customary (unless otherwise stated in the itinerary or
              pricing) in all parts of the world for services rendered (e.g.
              porters, coach drivers, guides, etc.) your tour manager may guide
              you in this regard.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your passport is the official document that is mandatory for every
              Client/ Customer to travel abroad. The customer should ensure that
              passport is valid at least six months after their arrival back in
              India. Customers should also ensure that their passports have
              sufficient blank pages for obtaining the required visas. In case
              you are obtaining a visa, please ensure that your passport is
              issued not more than ten years ago and that your passport has the
              correct date of birth, photo, sex, address, and the printed
              passport number matches with the perforated passport number. It is
              the customer’s responsibility to ensure that the passport is not
              damaged or stained.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case of loss/ theft/ damage of passport while on tour, all
              expenses like Airfare, Hotel accommodation, transportation, meals,
              or any other such or similar expenses along with costs incurred
              towards issuance of the new duplicate passport or emergency
              departure card or any other required documentation is the sole
              responsibility of the Client and will be borne by the Client. FIND
              N VIBE will not be responsible/ liable for the same.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is entirely the responsibility of the Client or Customer to
              arrange, provide and carry on tour valid travel documents
              including passport with necessary valid Visas and immigration
              clearance (if applicable), sufficient Foreign exchange, confirmed
              Air tickets, documents confirming insurance to cover the risk to
              life, limb and property for the duration of the tour, medical
              clearances, inoculations/ vaccination certificates as the case may
              be to be able to travel as per the tour itinerary.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is the Client’s/ Customer’s responsibility to collect in time
              the necessary travel documents submitted to FIND N VIBE from its
              registered office.
            </li>
            <li>
              Though the Airline tickets for the Client/ Customer issued for the
              particular sector may have confirmed status, due to overbooking of
              seats, flights getting delayed/postponed/cancelled due to
              technical problems, or any other reasons whatsoever, the airline
              may offload any passengers and accommodate him/her on a subsequent
              flight for which FIND N VIBE will not be responsible or liable.
              Also due to this if Client/ Customer misses his or her connecting
              flights or any sightseeing then FIND N VIBE will not be
              responsible or liable for the same.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a Client/customer on any tour wants to start or return on a
              different date/time/airline other than those selected by FIND N
              VIBE for the tour, it shall be solely the responsibility of that
              Client to purchase Air tickets on their own and FIND N VIBE will
              not be responsible or liable to refund airfare amount taken as a
              part of the tour package. It is the sole responsibility of every
              client/customer to reconfirm his / her Air tickets 72 hours before
              the date of departure and make his or her arrangement to reach the
              hotel from the airport and to reach the airport from the hotel.
            </li>
            <li>
              It may be noted that the tour cost does not include the insurance
              premium (unless mentioned otherwise) and that the clients shall
              have to acquire the same at their cost.
            </li>
            <li>
              The settlement of the insurance claim is solely at the discretion
              of the insurance company. FIND N VIBE cannot influence the
              decision on the same.
            </li>
            <li>
              As insurance is a contract between the insurance agent and client,
              FIND N VIBE is not liable towards any claim or rejection of claim
              arising out of such contract. FIND N VIBE is not liable to pay for
              any service other than that mentioned in the tour itinerary and
              agreed upon by both parties.
            </li>
