                emancipated by all their sins. Except for this, Ganga aarti,
                which occurs every evening around 7 pm makes everyone relinquish
                on their issues and get lost in shell voice and those aarti
                sounds. Every year, one of the oldest festivals of Varanasi, 5
                days of Ganga Mahotsav takes place after Diwali. This is
                celebrated to recollect the significance of the Ganga river and

                If one is yearning to visit Varanasi, then the winter season would
                be tremendous which is from October to February. Varanasi becomes
                one of the coolest places in this season due to the Northern area.
                And when the breeze touches, it gives different kinds of relief and
                peace which every visitors deserve. People can also visit in summer
                or monsoon seasons, but this will not be as convenient as winter.
                Because in summer, Varanasi heat temperature goes to 38 degrees and
                sightseeing with this whether becomes intolerable and unpleasant for
                visitors. Similarly in monsoon, all ghats and potholes get loaded
                with rainwater and this can become a hurdle for tourists if they
                were desperate to sightseeing.
